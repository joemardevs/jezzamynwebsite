                In 2014, I graduated from elementary with First Honorable mention and became high school in Cabaruan 
                Integrated School(our neighbor barangay) because there’s no offered high school in our barangay. High 
                school is great and at same time a tough part of my life. There’s a lot of sadness and disappointment. 
                A lot of responsibilities. I had to study hard for my mom whose working abroad for my future. Since grade 8, 
                my mom left us to go abroad for our needs in schooling. As the oldest daughter I need to take care of my 
                siblings and also taking care our home, laundries, dishes and cooking. The part of a high school student 
                without mom is really difficult. It was a hard time of my life but a lot of learning I had. Until our moving 
                up to senior high school happen. I went to the city to get my senior year. I studied at Cauayan City National 
                High School. City High school was really great, you will have a lot of friends to be and a support to your high 
                school life. I also remember I got my first boyfriend at grade 10 life. A High School lover until now that we 
                are in College. Year 2020 when I finally reach the adulting stage, I celebrated my debut without any party. 
                We just eat as a family but without my mom again. At this age, I realize that my mom is working far from us 
                to earn money for our future and now I understand that thing. Not until my graduation in High School came. 
                My mom promise to be there but she didn’t make it because of the pandemic. It was the saddest part of life 
                but I need to understand and continue studying. Although I have that huff in my heart but I manage to 
                understand that.

                During our vacation, I decided to find a job to have a experience. I work at Novo in cauayan as a saleslady. 
                It was my fist job actually, It is a great experience for me and then I decided to continue working and at the 
                same time studying. I decided to do both to support me in living. I tried to be independent. Studying is online
                 because of the pandemic. I enroll in Isabela State University Cauayan Campus in a course of Bachelor of Science
                  in Information Technology. I manage my time hard for me and I did it. I was really hard but at same time a 
                  happy and enjoyable part of my life. After 7 months at work, they promote me as a cashier and then after 4 
                  months I resigned. That was real quick. I resigned because I couldn’t manage anymore my time in learning. I 
                  can now feel the pressure in what to prioritize and that is studying. I need to focus in studying because I 
                  am now taking our midyear and I think I cant do learning and working with this. <br>
                  Now, I am currently studying and taking my two subject In my midyear class.
