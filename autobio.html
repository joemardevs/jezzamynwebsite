                Year 2002, 13th of October at 7 am in the morning a child named Jezzamyn was born in the middle of 
                nowhere in a rice field with the midwife of Barangay Rizal Alicia Isabela. It was a quite place to be 
                born but an unforgettable to my parents. I grew up to a loving and happy surrounding. I take my christening 
                at a Methodist church in Salinungan East, San Mateo Isabela. After my christening, at the age of 3 we moved 
                to Quinalabasa, Naguilian Isabela where we lived until now.  I do not remember much of my early childhood, but 
                my mom said I was the kid the kid that a friend of all because I was a very active, curious to little things, 
                healthy and communicative child. I didn’t remember how I celebrated my birthday because I was the first child 
                maybe they spoiled me with that, but now I don’t think so.

                I started studying when I was 5 and my teacher is my mom because she is teaching preschool in our place that 
                year. You may not believe this but my mom said I was not that kind kid in our school. I stabbed one of my 
                classmate in her face. That’s rude but my mama ‘palo’ me that day. I always sleep and cry at school when no 
                one wants to be my friend. After that, my parents enrolled me in Grade 1 and I was called ‘salingkit’ only in 
                our class. At the age of 6 I finished grade 1 with the award of third place in our class. Had to say, I was the 
                youngest but I’m subsequent. My elementary days are incredibly awesome. I gained many friends and I achieved 
                honors and awards in academic. Its been a quite jaded studying six years on the same school but its totally 
                fine because I enjoyed every single day with my friends and classmate with a lot of laugh and learning.
